# desirelovell
📌 Overview

This repository hosts the open-source codebase for the desirelovell app.
The project is built using v0.app, which provides an AI-powered builder environment.
Any changes made inside v0 are automatically synced to this repository and deployed by Vercel.

This repo welcomes contributions, improvements, issue reports, and forks from the community.

🚀 Deployment

Your live deployment is available at:
👉 https://vercel.com/desirelovellcoms-projects/v0-desirelovell
Vercel automatically deploys the latest synced commit from the main branch.
🛠 Build & Edit Your Spp
Most development happens inside the v0 builder:

👉 https://v0.app/chat/paHuZIxHFkC
When you publish changes from v0:
The updates sync to this repo
Vercel deploys the new version
The project stays version-controlled and open-source
If you want to extend or override generated code, you can add your own components or utilities directly in this repository.

🔄 How It Works
Build or modify the app using v0.app
Deploy changes inside v0
v0 auto-syncs changes to this GitHub repository
Vercel auto-deploys every update
The project remains fully open-source and transparent
This workflow gives you low-friction iteration, continuous deployment, and community visibility.

🧩 Repo Structure
You may see files created automatically by v0, such as:
.v0/ metadata
Generated components
Auto-managedlogic blocks
You can add additional code manually, but modifying generated files may be overwritten on the next sync.
Recommended approach
Put custom code in separate folders
Avoid editing files marked as auto-generated unless necessary
Use the v0 builder for UI and workflow logic

🔐 Environment Variables
If your app uses API keys or private services:
Add them using Vercel Environment Variable
Do not commit secrets into the repo
v0-managed variables should be configured through v0 settings
🧪 Testing

You may add tests manually if desired.
v0 does not generate tests by default, but the repository supports adding:

Jest
playwright
Cypress
